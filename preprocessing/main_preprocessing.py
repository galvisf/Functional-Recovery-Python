    '''Parameterize variables and simplifying assumptions to expedite the ATC138
    recovery assessment

    Parameters
    ----------
    comp_ds_table: DataFrame
      various component attributes by damage state for each component 
      within the performance model. Can be populated from the 
      component_attribites.csv and damage_state_attribute_mapping.csv 
      databases in the static_tables directory.  Each row of the table 
      corresponds to each column of the simulated component damage arrays 
      within damage['tenant_units'].
    
    damage: dictionary
      contains simulated damage info and damage state attributes
    
    repair_time_options['allow_shoring']: logical
      flag indicating whether or not shoring should be considered as a
      temporary repair for local stability issues for structural components
    
    temp_repair_class: DataFrame
      attributes of each temporary repair class to consider
    
    damage_consequences: dictionary
      dictionary containing simulated building consequences, such as red
    
    num_stories: int
      Integer number of stories in the building being assessed

    Returns
    -------
    damage: dictionary
      contains simulated damage info and damage state attributes
    
    temp_repair_class: DataFrame
      attributes of each temporary repair class to consider
    
    damage_consequences: dictionary
      dictionary containing simulated building consequences, such as red'''
